## Continuous Deployment with ArgoCD on EKS

### Objective: This project aims to introduce participants to GitOps principles and demonstrate continuous deployment using ArgoCD on Amazon EKS.

### Tasks:

#### * Install ArgoCD on the EKS cluster using Helm charts or Kubernetes manifests.
#### * Configure ArgoCD to synchronize applications with Git repositories containing Kubernetes manifests.
#### * Set up a sample application with GitOps best practices (e.g., separate environment branches).
#### * Automate application deployment using ArgoCD's application reconciliation feature.
#### * Implement automatic rollbacks in case of deployment failures or policy violations.
#### * Integrate ArgoCD with Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring application deployments and performance.
