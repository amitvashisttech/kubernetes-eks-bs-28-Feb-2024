### Objective: This project focuses on integrating Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) and S3 (Simple Storage Service) with Amazon EKS for data storage and management.

### Tasks: 

#### * Provision an Amazon RDS instance (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for database storage.
#### * Configure access control and security groups for the RDS instance.
#### * Set up an S3 bucket for object storage and configure access permissions.
#### * Deploy an application on Amazon EKS that interacts with the RDS database and S3 bucket.
#### * Implement data backup and restore strategies for RDS using AWS Backup.
#### * Utilize AWS CloudWatch for monitoring RDS performance metrics and S3 bucket usage.
